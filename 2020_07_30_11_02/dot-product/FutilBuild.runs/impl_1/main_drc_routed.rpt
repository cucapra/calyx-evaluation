2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP add1/out__0 input add1/out__0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP add1/out__0 input add1/out__0/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP incr0/out__0 input incr0/out__0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP incr0/out__0 input incr0/out__0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#5 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP incr0/out__0 input incr0/out__0/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#6 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP incr1/out__0 input incr1/out__0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#7 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP incr1/out__0 input incr1/out__0/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP add1/out__0 output add1/out__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP incr1/out__0 output incr1/out__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPREG-4#1 Warning
DSP48E1_PregDynOpmodeZmuxP:  
The DSP48E1 cell incr1/out__0 with the given dynamic OPMODE[6:0] connections may lead to an unregistered asynchronous feedback path without the PREG attribute enabled. Please refer to the user guide and if one of the internal P feedback opmodes is possible for this design the PREG attribute must be set to 1, currently set to 0
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-31#1 Advisory
enum_PREG_0_connects_CEP_GND  
incr1/out__0: When the DSP48E1 PREG attribute is set to 0, the CEP input pin should be tied to GND to save power.
Related violations: <none>
